# What do people want to know
  - is my neighborhood safe?

# What hunches or assumptions do people have?
  - calls around full moons

# Goals
  1. show overall most dangerous areas
  2. show geom_point of all crimes
  3. show any marked increases in crime not due to seasonality
  
  
 # Techniques
  - look at crime type by month for trends
  - look closely in Aug/May for trends around college starting
  - what is the worst weekend for drunk driving?
  - bar locations vs. DUI
  
# Fns to build
  - plotCrime()  # just crime type in heatmap over Fargo
  - plotPoints()  # point all crimes with color defining the crime type
  - plotFacet
